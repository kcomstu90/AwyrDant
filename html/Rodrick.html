		<p>Born Rodrick Theodore Gallentara, Roddy grew up in a stable house. His parents worked hard and he was left mostly to his own. Running through the town with his friends, Roddy soon learned how to make a quick copper off of sleight-of-hand tricks or by impressing traveling noble-people with his quick wit. At 14, he began working in the local tavern - Han’s Shots First - as a bar-boy. It didn’t take him long to figure out the regulars’ favorite drinks and how to keep customers coming back. </p>
		<br>
		<p>The local tavern master had his favorite drink too and indulged in it far too often. Over the next few years, Roddy took on more and more responsibility for the tavern. Shortly after Roddy turned 19, the tavern master was found sitting cold and stiff in a puddle of his own vomit. Roddy took over the tavern as his own, renaming it The Gallant Tears. Through charisma and a raucous laugh, he made his tavern the place to be every evening. However, it was discovered that he was watering down his ale to save that extra copper or two. In the outrage that followed he was hauled out behind his own tavern and beaten. Luckily for him, a high elf and half-elf happened to be walking down that same alley and, loving an underdog fight, joined him in defeating his former patrons. No longer having a place in town, he decides to strike out with his unlikely rescuers.  </p>
		<br>
		<p>After a year of wandering, he began to long to be behind a bar again. In a far-away land, no one knows the reputation of a disgraced barkeeper…  </p>
