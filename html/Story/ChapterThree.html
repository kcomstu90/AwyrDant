		<p> The Adventurers began to explore the rest of the ancient dwarven fort. They cautiously - laboriously cautiously - approached the first door: a great work of Dwarvish steel. There was sound from within, though very little. The barkeep decided to open the door ever so slowly. He hadn’t thought of the fact that old metal doors tend to be very loud. The sound of the door creaking open was akin to the sound a cat makes when drawn and quartered. Thankfully, the sound was coming from a solitary skeletal dwarf. They were able to dispatch it quickly enough. Beyond the walking corpse, nothing of any noteworthiness was found, save for a handful of letters from soldiers that were never delivered. How old must these letters be? Are any of their intended recipients even still alive? The party decided to hang onto them, just in case. </p>
		<br>
		<p>The party cautiously approached the door on the other side of the great hall. Upon arriving at the door, all they could tell was that there was movement inside, and it sounded like more than the previous room. Before venturing in, they decided to inspect the third, and apparently final room in the hall. Unlike the other rooms, this room was completely silent. Intrigued and slightly afraid, they slowly opened the door, not learning their lesson from the first one. But much to their surprise, this door glided open without a single sound to reveal… Nothing. The room was completely empty. The elf became immediately suspicious of traps. So, like any self-respecting elf did, he sent the half-elf in first to investigate. All was fine and good. “Check the torches” called out Niel. A good thought. Torches were often used to reveal hidden passages, or was that only in fairy tales? 
		These torches appeared ordinary enough, so the party decided to move on to the next room. 
		<br>
		<p>Roddy and Niel arrived at the door, and called on Balfour to open the door, only to realize that he was not with them. That’s when the realization set in that something was amiss. They went back to the middle room and yelled to Balfour, but to no avail. It seemed that he could neither see nor hear them. After several unsuccessful attempts to rescue him without venturing into the room, Niel tied a rope around Roddy and sent him in after Balfour. As he stepped into the room, the rope around his waist went slack, and the door disappeared behind him. </p>
		<br>
		<p>On the other side, Niel listened to Roddy and Balfour talk about their fate. He learned that they couldn’t see the door any longer. He decided to show Roddy that he was still on the other side by pulling on the rope. A particularly hard pull on the rope, coupled with Roddy losing his balance, led to Roddy flying right back toward the door. But, some mysterious force prevented him from exiting the room. With both of his comrades trapped firmly in an open room, Niel did the only thing any self-respecting elf would do: He tried to abandon them and leave the fort. It would seem that someone or something had other plans for the party. The main door to the fort had disappeared at some point.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Meanwhile, Roddy and Balfour had discovered part of the illusion in the room. There was a trap door in the floor. Once discovered, the door opened with relative ease. Before going down, Roddy decided to inspect the torches. He touched one of them, and suddenly, the trap door disappeared again. So! There was some magic to them after all. Roddy, ever the brilliant one, decided he should take these torches out of their sockets to see if that would affect anything… You know, hopefully for the better. Much to his luck, it did not. It was around this time that Niel came back to the doorway and saw Roddy walking around with one of the torches. He facepalmed. This was the group he’d decided to travel with. An apparently brainless barkeep and a half-elf, that no matter how much he tried, he couldn’t help feel a kind of bond with.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Niel then decided that since touching the torches hadn’t yet killed his friends (or minions, as he surely thought of them) that he would inspect one in another room. He was slightly smarter about this process, and didn’t touch them himself. Instead, he decided to pour some of his water on the torch to see if it was even real fire. The torch sizzled and sputtered, as you would expect from any torch having water poured on it.</p>
		<br>
		<p>After Roddy’s experiment with the torches, he and Balfour finally agreed to enter the trap door, once it had reappeared again. They got about ten feet into the tunnel that was beneath them when Roddy suddenly ran into what appeared to be a wall. Balfour was able to make it through with no issue, however. Roddy suddenly remembered the rope around his waist and took it off, even though it appeared slack. Suddenly, he was able to proceed without issue. Balfour warned of rats. He attempted to communicate with them, but quickly saw through yet another illusion. These were skeletal rats. Joy. More undead. And they were just as eternally angry as the rest. Balfour and Roddy found themselves surrounded by six of the buggers, each the size of a medium dog.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Niel, who had been listening, decided he’d best join his comrades, even though he wasn’t sure he’d ever be able to get out again. This was very uncharacteristic of a self-respecting elf, and yet he did it. He climbed down the ladder just in time to join combat. The small tunnels made it nearly impossible for them to fight, where the rats were able to stand side-by-side and fight. Nevertheless, they held their own, and destroyed the abominations. The magic that animated one of them seemed to fail suddenly, as it simply fell apart in the middle of combat.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Onward. Ever onward. Roddy blundered right into a pressure plate, causing a small, poisoned barb to stab him in the side. He was hardy enough to resist the effects of the poison, at least for now. Onward the party went, discovering and avoiding two additional traps. Suddenly, the tunnel began to shift and move around. The party found themselves in the middle of a room; a rather small room at that, with only a single doorway. On the left side of this door, a large crystal formation had grown out of the floor. Engraved above the door was this message, written in Common: </p>
		“Where one enters, one emerges.” <p>Followed by text that has obviously been gouged out, and replaced by the phrase</p>
		<h3>“though much fatter indeed.”</h3>
		<br>
		<p>The party decided they had better avoid the door. Except for Balfour. Confident this door was simply another illusion, he proceeded to enter the door. He disappeared instantly. Immediately afterward, a similar crystal structure grew out of the right side of the door, and the one on the left began to melt and break, much like a glacier. As it dwindled into nothing, a dwarf fell onto the floor, unconscious. Who was this? How long had he been entrapped here?</p>
