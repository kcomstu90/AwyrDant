		<p>The adventurers left the cave that had quickly gone from prison to “job opportunity” and began making their way toward the Dwarves’ camp. They stopped to hunt along the way, and stumbled upon a long-abandoned Dwarvish fort. The fort had fallen into the hands of some forgotten necromancer or another, and was still guarded by the skeletal minions he’d summoned. The adventurers found that their weapons were hardly effective against these monstrosities, save for the barkeep, who had grown accustomed to grabbing the nearest large blunt object and planting it firmly into the skull of rowdy patrons. His instincts proved equally useful against these only possibly-less-disgusting foes.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Once the guards were dealt with outside, the party approached the rest of the ruin much more cautiously, having learned of their disadvantage. The rest of the exterior was quiet as the grave… Well, the undisturbed grave, that is. From the outside, the main building, and the only one still standing, appeared to have four chambers: One large central chamber, and three much smaller chambers protruding from it.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Inside, the party were greeted by some additional skeletons in the main chamber. These proved much less hardy than their ghastly compatriots, and the adventurers were quickly able to dispatch them. Very little of use was found in the main chamber. Unusual for a Dwarvish fortress. The likely explanation is that it was simply looted long ago, before the undead settled in.</p>
