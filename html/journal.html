		<h3><u>Chapter One</u></h3>
			<p>Caught in the middle of a fight in Avanyarci, we were captured by the Elves and brought to a cave. Calcior accused us of being spies for the dwarves and gave us the choice of spying on the dwarves for him or face execution.We agreed to be his spies and he gave us our orders. To assist us, Calcior freed us and gave us the following items.
				<ul style="text-align: left; list-style-type: circle; list-style-position: inside">
					<li>Rodrick: Ring, +1 to attack rolls</li>
					<li>Eirneall: Rapier, +2 damage</li>
				</ul>
			<p>Just after being released, Dwarves attacked the cave. Calcior ordered us rebound and we were discovered thus by the Dwarves. Thinking us enemies of the elves, we were untied and told we were welcomed in their camps. Searching the cave, we found 1000gp and split them among ourselves.</p>

		<h3><u>Chapter Two</u></h3>
			<p>On our way to the closest Dwarven camp, we found an old Dwarven ruin. Barely fending off attacks by skeletal wolves, we entered the ruin. Animated dwarven skeletons defended the central hall, but we made short work of them. </p>
			<br>
			<p>It turns out that piercing weapons are worthless against skeletal enemies.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Low on health and tired from fighting, we decided to rest a while before exploring the three side rooms in the ruin.</p>

		<h3><u>Chapter Three</u></h3>
			<p>First door. Listened outside. Slight movement. Enter. One skeleton, quickly dispatched. Chests in room contained old letters from soldiers, never delievered. Maybe track down intended recipients?</p>
			<br>
			<p>Second door. Listened outside. More movement than last. Decided to check third door.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Third Door. Listened outside. Nothing. Opened door. Empty room with torches on wall. Balfour explored, examined torches, nothing happened. Back to the second door.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Second door. Realized Balfour wasn't with us. Appeared to be stuck inside the third room, couldn't see/hear us. Niel tied rope around Roddy, Roddy entered room and became bewitched too. Niel tried to leave fort, but door was gone. Roddy and Balfour found trap door in floor, entered. Find tunnel, started going through it. Skeletal rats engaged, flanked us. Niel entered enchanted room and came down tunnel. We fought off the rats.</p>

			<p>Encountered several traps as we moved through the tunnel. Suddenly tunnel disappeared and we were in a small room with a door. Crystal on one side. Sign above door read "Where one enteres, one emerges... though much fatter indeed" in Common. Balfour enters door and disappeared. Crystal grew on other side of door while the first crystal melted. Unconcious dwarf?</p>
