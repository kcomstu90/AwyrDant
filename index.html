		<p>Awyr Dant - mountain of legend. Also known as T'sa Cbili by the elves, it is the site of centuries of war between the archetypal enemies - Elves and Dwarves. Surrounded by hundreds of square miles of forest the elves hold so dear, yet, at its core, solid rock that no sane dwarf would ever give up. Long have armies fought on its slopes, blood running in thick rivulets down its broad slopes. Heroes were born and legends died fighting for their cause in vast groves and caverns. </p>
		<br>
		<p>On Awyn Dant's northern slope, the great dwarven city of Corachod was finally captured by the elven baron Calci close to 50 years ago. Calci razed Corachad the ground, disgusted with the unpleasing harsh lines and stone. In spite, he used dwarven slaves to rebuild the city in a style more suitable to elves, naming it Samot'cis.  </p>
		<br>

		<p><b>Heirs of the Sky</b> have been on T'sa Cbili since before the war ever started. They first came to the mountain to purge one of the greatest necromancers of that age. They fought for years before they had their victory. It was decided that they would stay in order to prevent darkness from ruling the mountain once more. It has been a long and bloody fight. There have been times where the Heirs had almost completely purged the many caverns and tunnels in the mountain, but it would always return with a vengeance only to bring the Heirs nearly to their demise decades later. This constant power struggle only got worse once Calci came to the mountain to wage war on Corachod. The Heirs tried to remain neutral in the war for the sake of holding what ground they had taken. But many of the Heirs at that time were High Elves, and their loyalties became mixed between Calci and the oath they swore as Paladins. The Chancellor of the Sky held the Order together, but only barely, and not before some members abandoned their call to join the war.</p>
		<br>
		<p><b>Moradin's Hammer</b> was not founded under traditional pretenses, nor was it a traditional Order of Paladins. It was started by dwarves who had seen atrocities committed by Heirs of the Sky, the only longstanding Order on Awyr Dant. These dwarves founded the order to begin investigating the acts of the Heirs. Their fears were that the Heirs had fallen to the very darkness they had fought against for so long on the mountain.</p>
		<br>
		<p>The Hammers were a small group in that age. Very few were willing to answer the call at that time, because it meant walking away from the war for their homeland. There were barely more than a dozen members when the Order was founded; 13 members not including the Order Chancellor.</p>
		<br>
		<p>These members started the Inquisition of the Sky, as it is remembered by the historians. They began capturing Heirs that were fighting for Calci against Tad's forces and holding very publicized trials for them. There were 30 such trials recorded, and in all but three of these trials, it was found that the individual had broken the Heir's oath in order to serve Calci. These Ex-Paladins were banished from any city that the Dwarves still controlled, and were stripped of their standing with the Heirs. </p>
		<br>
		<p>The three that were found to be operating within the confines of their oaths were released back to the Heirs. It was never discovered exactly what the Chancellor of the Sky had commissioned these three to do, which planted a seed of distrust among the Hammers. In the eyes of the people, the Heirs could no longer be trusted, and for many years, they got very cold looks from the people they had sworn to protect.</p>
		<br>
		<p>The original Hammers, who had found the Heirs of the Sky blameless in these trials, held no ill will toward them, and did what they could to rebuild the Heirs standing with the public. This mutual trust eroded as the Hammers grew in number. Many of the new Hammers distrusted the Heirs, and would not be convinced otherwise. The chancellors of both Orders met many times to discuss how they could reunite the two, but all of their attempts seemed to be in vain.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Eventually these talks ceased, and the two Orders worked almost entirely independently of one another.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Since the war ended, the Heirs once again managed to reclaim much of the mountain. Bound by their oaths to law, they have rebuilt their headquarters in Samot 'cis, and serve among the police and town guard for the city, as well as in the smaller towns. Their presence is welcomed by most, as they always work within the confines of the law. No one questions that, but some do question how Good their intentions are.</p>
